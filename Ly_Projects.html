The project was assigned in CSE with the objective of getting students to understand and learn how to code, and challenges included an unproductive partner, frequent debugging, and mandatory documentation. The game itself is noted for its semi-communist humor and light-hearted tone but harsh consequences when the player fails a task... or disobeys orders (Don't worry, no cats were harmed in the production of the game).</p>

The project was assigned in CSE to help students learn the basics of web development and responsive design. Several challenges I had to overcome were mostly learning the new language, debugging the code routinely, and organizing code into a readable fashion. I consider this website to be a competent one that is reasonably well-developed but I realize there is still room for improvement. (Clicking the picture will bring you back to the home page).</p>
