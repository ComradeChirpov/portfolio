                    Hello, my name is Johnathan Ly and I am a student at DHS, and my goal is to get into college with an intent to get a useful degree in the engineering or medical fields. It is natural to want to get college education, as it significantly broadens one's opportunities and career options. In order to achieve this goal, I will have to pay attention in my classes, study hard, and also plan for the long run.<br><br>
                    I am currenty in Computer Science and Engineering and I like CSS more than HTML even though both languages are necessary for making good webpages. From what I understand, both are in a symbiotic relationship. HTML is needed to format the content while CSS is used for making the content stand out and be interesting. However, I like CSS as it is always entertaining to find the right proportions. It is always a task making webpages user-friendly on all platforms.<br><br>
                    I like to build computers in my spare time and swim. Sometimes, I go on road trips with my family to Seattle or I will take a plane to Canada. I have mostly "A" grades in school and am having a good time at Dublin High. Additionally, I do some graphics designing. Most, if not all, of the pictures and art featured on this website were personally made by me.<br><br>
                    I hope you enjoy the website. I encourage you to explore and have fun! If you have any questions, feel free to contact me on my Contact Me page. Thank you for reading and have a good time.
